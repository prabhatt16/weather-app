Greetings,

It's a weather app where you can see weather details like temperature, city name, humidity and feel like status. For implementation, I used React.js, HTML, TailwindCSS and JavaScript. App hosted in vercel.

You can follow these steps to run this app:

1. First clone the github repo by using this command "git clone https://github.com/prabhatt16/weather-app.git". 
2. Open your terminal and install node modules using "npm install" command.
3. Then run the command "npm start" to start the app. It will show the output in chrome.
